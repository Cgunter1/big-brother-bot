# big-brother-bot
This a discord bot that will monitor messages on a guild and make sure no one says anything not allowed. If so, it either deletes it or edits it with a more appropriate word.

# Goals
1. Set Up the code, so it can read and detect words/phrases in messages. Limit of words per phrase would be like 3 (i.e. "Hello My World" would be a 3 worded phrase).
2. Next, get the word detection to work with the discord bot interface, so when any message is sent in any guild it belongs too, it runs it through the functions implemented in goal #1.
3. Make it so it could possibly read links for websites and youtube videos also.
4. **Hopeful Goal:** Add functionality with Google's Vision API so it can also read images also.
